# Viewing Monitoring Data in Google Cloud Platform

## 1. Enable Google Cloud Monitoring API
Ensure that the Cloud Monitoring API is enabled for your project:

```sh
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
```

## 2. Set Up Cloud Monitoring for Your Kubernetes Cluster
If you haven't already, install the Google Cloud Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver) agents on your Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-stackdriver/blob/master/kubernetes/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/agent-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-stackdriver/blob/master/kubernetes/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/agent-daemonset.yaml
```

## 3. Create a Monitoring Workspace
- Go to the Google Cloud Console.
- Navigate to Monitoring.
- Follow the prompts to create a new workspace if you donâ€™t already have one set up.

## 4. Access Metrics and Dashboards
- In the Google Cloud Console, go to Monitoring > Dashboards.
- You can use the default dashboards provided or create custom dashboards.

## 5. Create a Custom Dashboard
- In the Monitoring section, click on Dashboards and then Create Dashboard.
- Name your dashboard (e.g., "Microservices Monitoring").
- Add widgets to display metrics for CPU usage, memory usage, request latency, error rates, and other relevant metrics.

## 6. Add Metrics to the Dashboard
- Add a Chart: Click on Add Chart.
- Configure the Chart:
  - Select Resource Type (e.g., Kubernetes Container).
  - Select the Metric (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, request count).
  - Apply any necessary filters (e.g., by namespace, service, or instance).
- Save the Chart: Click Save to add the chart to your dashboard.

## 7. Set Up Alerts
- Go to Monitoring > Alerting.
- Click on Create Policy.
- Define the conditions for your alert (e.g., CPU usage above 80% for 5 minutes).
- Set up notifications (e.g., email, SMS, webhook) to receive alerts when the conditions are met.
- Name your alert policy and click Save.

## 8. Viewing Logs
- Go to Logging in the Google Cloud Console to view logs from your Kubernetes cluster.
- Use the query builder to filter logs by resource type, namespace, and other parameters.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can reproduce the load generation setup and test the performance of your microservices architecture using Locust. You can also set up and view monitoring data in Google Cloud Platform to gain insights into the system's scalability, reliability, and performance under load. The generated report and monitoring dashboards will provide valuable metrics for analyzing and improving your microservices.
